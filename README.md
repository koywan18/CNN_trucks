This repository introduces a classification algorithm for CDR data in order to identify trucks

## Methodology
Preprocessed CDRdata is passed through a supervised deep-learning algorithm. More specifically, a CNN is fed with a blend of raw and aggregated features to issue predictions for each IMSI.
This allow to capture both geographical and mobility patterns.

### Aggregated features
### Raw data heatmap
### Results
